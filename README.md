# project-relyfe
Project ReLyfe is a community effort to give older tablets and Chromebooks a second life. Most of these devices don’t fail because the hardware is worn out—they fail because the software ecosystem abandons them. That’s wasteful, expensive, and unnecessary.

I go by ReLyfe Dad, and I started this project because families shouldn’t have to replace perfectly good hardware just because a manufacturer stopped supporting it. After rebuilding my life and home from the ground up, I became painfully aware of how much good tech gets thrown away for no real reason. That frustration turned into mission.

I’ve worked with tech long enough to understand how it breaks and how it survives. I’m not a kernel engineer, I’m not a ROM wizard — I’m the guy making sure the end result is something real families can use. That includes organizing the mission, testing ideas, documenting our work, and keeping the vision grounded.

*Our Immediate Goal*

Create a lightweight, stable OS for older tablets and Chromebooks that:

boots fast

runs basic apps smoothly

works well for kids 

removes bloat

gives parents control

extends device life by years

We will adapt existing open-source systems instead of reinventing everything from scratch. The goal is practicality and accessibility.

Why This Matters?

Families shouldn’t lose access to tech because of forced upgrades.
Schools shouldn’t trash thousands of devices due to expired update windows.
Communities shouldn’t drown in e-waste. There are enough talented people out there who
can help create real solutions. If we team up, we can eventually make a difference. 

We can build a real alternative.

How You Can Help

We’re looking for contributors with skills in:

OS/ROM adaptation

kernel and driver work

device testing

lightweight UI design

documentation

tech-literacy education

installer tooling

If you’ve ever looked at an old device and thought, this shouldn’t be trash, you already understand our mission.

The Bigger Mission

ReLyfe isn’t just about software — it’s about tech literacy.

People don’t need to become developers.
They just need to understand the basics without fear or confusion.

Long-term goals include:

community repair cafés

tech-literacy workshops

simple guides

school and nonprofit partnerships

It all starts with giving these devices a second life.
