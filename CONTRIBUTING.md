Thanks for being here.
Project ReLyfe exists because families and communities deserve technology that lasts longer than a manufacturer’s support window. Reducing e-waste and improving tech literacy is a mission that belongs to everyone, and this project moves forward through community effort — not individual spotlight.

Whether you're a developer, a tinkerer, an educator, or someone who just wants to help give old hardware a second chance, you're welcome here. This is a collaborative space where contributions of all sizes matter.

Our Mission

Give older tablets and Chromebooks a second life by building a lightweight, clean, kid-friendly OS based on open-source foundations.

Improve tech literacy for everyday people by explaining technology in simple, practical terms that build confidence rather than confusion.

If your contribution supports either of these goals, you’re in the right place.

Ways You Can Contribute
Developers

Help is needed in areas such as:

OS/ROM adaptation

kernel and driver support

stability and security work

Anyone frustrated by planned obsolescence will feel at home here.

Device Testers

If you have older devices available, you can contribute by:

No programming skills required.

Community Values
Everyone is welcome

Beginners, experts, teachers, parents, students. This project is for everyone.

Respect first

We keep communication constructive. We fix tech, not people.

Stay legal

No piracy, no bypassing locked systems, no unauthorized firmware.

No gatekeeping

Asking questions is encouraged. No one is expected to know everything.

Mission-driven

Everything we build should meaningfully reduce e-waste or improve tech literacy.
